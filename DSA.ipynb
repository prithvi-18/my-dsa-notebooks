    "## Day 1: Arrays and Two-Pointer/Sliding-Window Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "On Day 1, we focus on array-based techniques. A common strategy is the **two-pointer technique**, which uses two indices (often at opposite ends of a sorted array) and moves them inward to find a desired condition. For example, to find two numbers summing to a target, initialize pointers `left=0`, `right=n-1` and adjust them based on the current sum. This runs in *O(n)* time by leveraging the sorted order. Another key technique is the **sliding-window technique**, which efficiently handles subarray/subsequence problems by maintaining a moving window of elements. Instead of recomputing a subarray sum from scratch, we ‚Äúslide‚Äù the window and update the sum using previous results (like reusing work as the window shifts). Sliding windows are ideal for problems like finding maximum subarray sums of fixed size or longest substring without repeating characters. Intuitively, two-pointers is like two people meeting from opposite ends of a line, adjusting direction as needed, while sliding window is like scanning through data with a fixed-size frame that moves steadily. These methods dramatically reduce redundant computation on Day 1.\n",

    "## Day 2: String Manipulation and Sliding-Window Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "On Day 2, we tackle string algorithms using similar techniques. A primary focus is on **string traversal patterns** (often leveraging sliding windows). For example, finding the longest substring with distinct characters uses a variable-size sliding window to expand and contract as characters repeat. We also practice **two-pointer methods on strings** ‚Äì e.g. checking palindromes by starting one pointer at the string‚Äôs beginning and one at the end and moving inward. Efficient string manipulation often means avoiding repeated scans; sliding windows let us reuse partial results when extending or shrinking the window. Intuitively, checking for a palindrome is like comparing letters from the two ends toward the center, while finding unique substrings is like moving a window over the text and adjusting its size. These patterns form the backbone of many string problems.\n",

    "## Day 3: Binary Search and Divide-and-Conquer\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 3 covers efficient **searching algorithms**, most notably **binary search**. Binary search works on sorted arrays by repeatedly halving the search interval. At each step, we compare the target to the middle element and discard the irrelevant half. This divide-and-conquer approach reduces the time complexity to *O(log n)*. For example, finding a value‚Äôs index in a sorted array is vastly faster with binary search than linear scan. We also practice applying binary search in creative ways (e.g. searching in a rotated array or finding a boundary condition). The key intuition is like looking up a word in a dictionary: you repeatedly open to the middle to decide which half to search next. Mastery of binary search on Day 3 underpins many higher-level techniques.\n",

    "\n",
    "On Day 4, we study **linked lists**, a non-contiguous data structure where each node points to the next. Linked lists allow efficient insertion and deletion compared to arrays, at the cost of sequential access. We cover singly linked lists (nodes with a single ‚Äúnext‚Äù pointer) and practice basic operations: traversing, inserting at head/tail, and searching. For example, iterating over a linked list is like walking down a chain: you start at the head node and follow each pointer to the next until the end. Understanding pointers in linked lists is crucial; Day 4 also emphasizes writing clean code to manipulate node references. Analogously, a linked list is like a train of wagons, where cars (nodes) link together, and decoupling or attaching cars (insertion/deletion) only requires adjusting a couple of links.\n",

Reversing involves re-pointing each node‚Äôs `next` to its previous node (effectively changing the chain direction). For example, reversing 1‚Üí2‚Üí3 yields 3‚Üí2‚Üí1 by iteratively moving through the list and redirecting links. We also examine two-pointer methods on lists (like fast/slow pointers for cycle detection). These exercises reinforce pointer management and help visualize how data flows through dynamic structures. A helpful intuition is to think of reversing as re-linking each wagon of a train in the opposite order: you detach one car at a time and attach it in front of the train.\n",

    "\n",
    "On Day 8 we introduce **binary trees**. A binary tree node has up to two children (left and right). Fundamental concepts include *root*, *leaf*, and node depth. We emphasize **tree traversals**: depth-first searches (pre-order, in-order, post-order) and breadth-first (level-order). In preorder, for example, we visit the current node before its subtrees (root‚Äìleft‚Äìright). Such traversals are typically implemented with recursion or a stack. Understanding trees often uses recursive intuition: a tree is defined in terms of smaller trees. A real-world analogy is an organizational chart, where exploring all subordinates (levels) can be done top-down (DFS) or level-by-level (BFS). Day 8‚Äôs practice reinforces writing recursive tree functions and visualizing the call stack as we traverse.\n",
